I'm currently live in **Stratford, CT**. I worked for **GE Capital** in Norwalk CT as an _Enterprise Data Architect_. 

As most have heard GE Capital has been divested and different parts of the company are being sold to other 

companies. I decided while going through the process of divestiture to gain my Masters of Computer Science. 

I already have an MBA, but want to attain a Master in Computer Science for more senior level IT roles. 

I currently have 15 years of program experience in multiple languages. My current work helps me to maintain 

my skills in java, ruby, and assorted scripting languages. Java OO is great and provides many different 

advantages.I took the python class to learn more about the language. I enjoy learning new languages and have 

a knack for learning them quickly.  An interesting thing about me is that during my last year in high school 

I worked for NASA as and Associate Engineer and worked inside one of the space shuttle payload compartments. 

I wish it was in space at the time, but I don't think my parents would want me in space.I have certifications 

for PMP and CISSP so I know a little about project management and system security.
